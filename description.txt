The Amulet of Many Minions is designed to add variety to the vanilla summoner progression while staying at least somewhat
in line with vanilla balance. It adds a new, directly controllable minion type called the Squire,
over a dozen new "standard" minions, 3 accessories, and an early pre-hardmode armor set to the game.

Note: This mod is currently only tested in single player.
