The Amulet of Many Minions is designed to add variety to the vanilla summoner progression while staying relatively in line with
vanilla balance. It adds over a dozen new minions, 3 accessories, and an early pre-hardmode armor set to the game.

Note: This mod is currently only tested in single player.
